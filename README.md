<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
  I am a full stack developer having experience of 3+ years in learning software development and building projects. I am based out of India. During the past few years, I spent my time learning the various frameworks while building various apps such as a blog app, ecommerce app, info tech website, fintech products and a bunch of other applications. I am also trying to understand the beauty of Algorithms and how they are an important part of modern day softwares.

<p>Being an Engineer, I love the idea of building products to solve real life problems, and I'm trying to be good at that.</p>
